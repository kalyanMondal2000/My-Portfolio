        <h2>PacMan Factory :</h2>
        <a href="https://kalyanmondal2000.github.io/PacmanFactoryJS/">Go to project!</a>
        <p>In this project, I made a Pacman factory, where the user creates new pacman's and can control when they start to move. I 
            had to write logic to move the pacmen and make them bounce.

        <h2>Eye Movement :</h2>
        <a href="https://kalyanmondal2000.github.io/eyemovement/">Go to project!</a>
        <p>For the eye movement project, I created two eyes that follow the cursor. I applied the logic and added a new eye in the html and used 
            a loop to apply the logic to the second eye.
