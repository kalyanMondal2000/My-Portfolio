        <h1>My Projects</h1>
        <p>These are some of my favorite projects which I made using JS, HTML and CSS. </p>
        </div>
        <div class ="projectPacman">
        <h2>PacMan Factory :</h2>
        <a href="https://kalyanmondal2000.github.io/PacmanFactoryJS/">Go to project!</a>
        <p>In this project, I made a Pacman factory, where the user creates new pacman's and can control when they start to move. I 
            had to write logic to move the pacmen and make them bounce. 
        <h2>Map tracker</h2>
        <a href="file:///Users/kalyanmondal/Desktop/JavaScriptBootcamp/Part_2/Week_3/my_mapKalyan.html">Go to project!</a>
        <p>I used mapbox to load a map and create a marker. I made an array of the coordinates and iterated through them allowing 
            the marker to move to each location. 
        </p>

    <div class="projectEyes">
        <h2>Eye Movement :</h2>
        <a href="https://kalyanmondal2000.github.io/eyemovement/">Go to project!</a>
        <p>For the eye movement project, I created two eyes that follow the cursor. I applied the logic and added a new eye in the html and used 
            a loop to apply the logic to the second eye.
