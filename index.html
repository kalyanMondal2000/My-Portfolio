            <h2>Bio</h2>
            <p>I know Javascript, HTML, CSS, Python and Java. I enjoy playing video games like GTA V, 
                RDR2, Mortal Kambat X(and 11), Forza as well as Minecraft. I am 
                very interested in the development of video games as a customer myself. I am 
                also capable of using an Arduino Uno and have some experience with robotics and wiring.
