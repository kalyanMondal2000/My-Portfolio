            <h2>Bio</h2>
            <p>I know Javascript, HTML, CSS, Python and Java. I enjoy playing video games like GTA V, 
                RDR2, Mortal Kombat X(and 11), Forza as well as Minecraft. I am 
                very interested in the development of video games and would like to learn about that in the future. I have some experience 
                using an Arduino Uno and making circuits. I have also participated in robotics, making actuators and wiring.
